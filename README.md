# FCRB Fluxor's Custom Radio Binds
Fluxor's Custom Radio Binds for CounterStrike 2. Be Respectful of others! Enjoy, have fun and be creative with your callouts!

DOWNLOAD either FCRB.cfg.rar (archive) or alternatively the file FCRB.cfg as well as the folder named FCRB-CC with all of its content at https://github.com/0-Fluxor/FCRB.

INSTALLATION

>> Open the Steam desktop app and navigate to your Library tab then locate your CS2 game. 

>> Right click the game and click on "Properties." Under the "GENERAL" tab look for field called "LAUNCH OPTIONS" add the following without qoutes "+exec FCRB.cfg" at the end of your launch options. 

>> **NOTE it will override bindings from other config files set to load before it but will not natively alter those other config files.** 

>> Next extract the archive into your Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg folder. 

>> Tags for file names will have the the following "CC-RC" or "CC-MC" before the title of each file. They stand for "Custom Content - Radio Commands" and "Custom Content - Message Commands."

>> You can rename your sub files found in "FCRB-CC" folder to whatever you want but I'd suggest not to do that. Instead just simply make your own and add them to the master FCRB config file. Just remember to update the existing alias or create a new alias directory in the master config FCRB.cfg!

UNINSTALL

>> Simply delete the FCRB.cfg file as well as the FCRB-CC folder that has the associated files tags "CC-RC" and "CC-MC." Then go to the game's launch options "STEAM" > "LIBRARY" > RIGHTCLICK CS2 > PROPERTIES > under GENERAL field "LAUNCH OPTIONS" and remove +exec FCRB.cfg from the launch options. 

**You can update your callouts live in game! I key binded F3 by default to load config file and console will display your changes!!**
